Quiz Answer Key
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides users with basic computing infrastructure like servers and storage, PaaS (Platform as a Service) offers a platform for developing and deploying applications, and SaaS (Software as a Service) delivers ready-to-use software applications over the internet.
Virtualisation allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, optimising resource utilisation, while containerisation packages applications with their dependencies for consistent execution across different environments. Both technologies contribute to the flexibility and scalability of cloud computing.
Cloud adoption requires careful planning, considering factors like security, cost, and integration with existing systems. Governance ensures responsible and compliant use of cloud resources through policies, procedures, and monitoring mechanisms.
Serverless computing abstracts away server management, allowing developers to focus solely on code. Google Cloud Functions is an example where code is executed in response to events, scaling automatically based on demand.
A data lake is a centralised repository that stores raw data in its native format, enabling flexible analysis and exploration. Traditional databases, on the other hand, store structured data for specific transactional purposes.
DevSecOps integrates security practices throughout the software development lifecycle, promoting collaboration between development, security, and operations teams to build secure and reliable cloud applications.
Ethical concerns with AI in cloud computing include bias in algorithms, potential for misuse, privacy violations, and lack of transparency in decision-making processes.
RAG enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge sources. During inference, the model retrieves relevant information from these sources to generate more informative and contextually appropriate responses.
The GDPR is a comprehensive data protection regulation in the EU that aims to protect the personal data of individuals, granting them rights over their data and setting obligations for organisations handling that data.
Data ethics in smart meters is crucial due to the potential for detailed personal information to be gathered and potentially misused. Transparency, consent, and security measures are vital to protect consumer privacy and ensure responsible use of the collected data.
Essay Questions
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of adopting a cloud platform for a large organisation. Consider factors such as cost, security, scalability, and data governance.
Analyse the evolution of data storage in the cloud, from traditional databases to data lakes and big data solutions. Explain the implications of these advancements for businesses and data analytics.
Critically evaluate the ethical implications of large language models and generative AI. Explore concerns related to bias, misinformation, and the potential impact on society.
Compare and contrast the different deployment models of cloud computing: public, private, and hybrid. Discuss the suitability of each model for various business scenarios and security requirements.
Examine the role of international data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and the OECD Privacy Guidelines, in shaping the ethical landscape of cloud computing and data management.
